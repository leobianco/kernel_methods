# kernel_methods
Implementation done concerning the data challenge of the course Kernel Methods at the master MVA. The objective was to classify images from a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset using exclusively kernel methods and our own code, i.e., without the aid of libraries such as libsvm or sklearn. 
To test our methods you should run the script start.py.
